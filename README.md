Metro Train APU Fault Detection Using Machine Learning
This project uses machine learning techniques to detect potential faults or abnormal behaviors in Metro Train Auxiliary Power Units (APUs). By analyzing operational data and applying predictive algorithms, this solution aims to support condition-based maintenance and improve railway safety and efficiency.
